This program is designed to describe the development of a wheat canopy across the season. Added functionality will include the ablility to ascertain differential characteristics between different lines at certain times. More functionality will be added as the project progresses. This read me will be updated inline with the development of the project.

13 / 2 / 14 - The basics of the program have  been coded, this includes modules for:
- Data input
- The equation to be fitted for parameters
- The equation to be fitted using those parameters
- The equation to calculate the residuals at each data point
- The function to fit the curve to the data point and therefore derive the parameters
- The equation to find the rfr at each x, and the maximum value of rfr, plus the corresponding tt value
- A module calculating the tt to senescence
- A module to calculate the difference in rfr between two tt values
- A module to calculate PAR accumulated between two time points
- A module to calculate the rfr value n days after a given time point

Testing - will include functionality, and optimally running these modules
